# Hi There 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎒 I am Onur, a **Software Engineer** (specializing in **Swift Applications**), and a full-time nomad, indie maker, and a minimalist from Germany. I am currently enjoying the digital nomad lifestyle by working remotely and traveling through the world since 2019. 

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills

📚 I also love reading books on **personal-** & **indie deelopment**. My favorite one is [**MAKE**](https://makebook.io) by _Pieter Levels_

🐦 Follow my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nryrk) where I tweet about building software in public.
