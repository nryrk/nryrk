🎒 I am Onur, a **Software Engineer** (specialized in **Swift Applications**), full-time nomad and a minimalist from Germany. 
I graduated in computer science (bachelor's degree) in 2019 at the University of Kassel, Germany, and have been in the software engineering industry ever since by working 100% remotely. I travel through the world since 2019 next to my work and I only own what fits in my backpack. I have visited 40+ countries so far and got to know many cultures and areas.

🎸 Outside the world of tech & travel, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. I really enjoy playing acoustic guitar, which I taught myself.

📚 I also love reading books about **personal-** & **indie development**. My favorite one is [MAKE](https://makebook.io) by *Pieter Levels*.

🐦 Follow my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nryrk) where I tweet about building software in public and try to live the indie hacker dream.
